Plan is as follows:

1. Collect a whole lot of mp3 or wav files (or at least find a music dataset to trian the model)
2. Use librosa to extract features from each audio file and use strictly the first 30 seconds of the file to create the spectrograph image
3. Create some neural network architecture to predict the genre of each song
4. ???
5. Profit
